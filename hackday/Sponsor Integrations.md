# Sponsor Integrations

Wire a sponsor tool into your agent. **Pick one and follow it top to bottom.**

| Sponsor | What you get | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Neo4j](#neo4j)** | Agent queries a graph database | ~15 min |
| **[Crusoe / Nebius](#crusoe--nebius-via-openrouter)** | Agent runs on their GPUs via OpenRouter | ~10 min |
| **[Vultr](#vultr)** | Agent calls the Vultr API | ~10 min |

Prerequisite: platform running — [Installing DevKit.md](<Installing DevKit.md>).

> **Prize note:** every tool you connect must *do something* in your project. Plugged in and idle doesn't count.

## Neo4j

The agent talks to the graph through the `mcp-neo4j-cypher` MCP server.

### Get a graph first

1. [console.neo4j.io](https://console.neo4j.io) → sign up
2. **New Instance** → **AuraDB Free**
3. Name it, pick a region, **Create**
4. **Click "Download to continue" immediately** — the password is shown once and cannot be recovered
5. From **Connection details**, collect:

| Value | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `uri` | `neo4j+s://<instance-id>.databases.neo4j.io` |
| `username` | `neo4j` |
| `password` | from the downloaded file |
| `database` | `neo4j` |

### 1. Register the MCP server

**AI Admin → MCP Servers → Add**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `neo4j-mcp` |
| Provider Type | **`Other`** → type `other` in the text box |
| Config Type | **`Raw`** |

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "neo4j": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/mcp-neo4j-cypher",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "NEO4J_URI": "${credential.uri}",
        "NEO4J_USERNAME": "${credential.username}",
        "NEO4J_PASSWORD": "${credential.password}",
        "NEO4J_DATABASE": "${credential.database}",
        "NEO4J_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "NEO4J_SCHEMA_SAMPLE_SIZE": "1000",
        "MCP_TIMEOUT": "7000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Create.**

### 2. Create the provider

**Providers → IT → Other → Add**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `neo4j-mcp` |
| Type | `Other` |
| Account ID | your `uri` |

**Next.**

![Add Provider filled in](images/neo4j-04-add-provider-filled.png)

### 3. Add credentials

Name it `neo4j-credentials`, then add four fields — **names must match the `${credential.*}` keys exactly, lowercase:**

`uri` · `username` · `password` · `database`

Leave Type `String` and Sensitive on. **Next.**

![Credentials, all four fields](images/neo4j-06-credentials-filled.png)

### 4. Create the scope — **skip the wizard step**

On the Scope page, select both the Neo4j credential and the MCP server.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `neo4j-mcp-scope` |
| Credential | `neo4j-credentials` |
| MCP Server | `neo4j-mcp` |

![Wizard scope step](images/neo4j-07-wizard-scope-optional.png)

<details>
<summary>Got <code>provider type '' does not match</code>?</summary>

You left Provider Type blank in step 1. **AI Admin → MCP Servers → neo4j-mcp → Edit** → set Provider Type to `Other` and type `other` in the box. Retry Add Scope.

![Provider type error](images/neo4j-09-scope-error.png)

![Fix: set provider type](images/neo4j-10-mcp-provider-type-fix.png)
</details>

### 5. Attach to a workspace

From the **Scope Created** prompt (or Scope tab → row menu), pick your workspace → **Attach**.

![Workspace scope count](images/neo4j-11-workspace-scopes.png)

### 6. Enable on a ticket

In the top navigation, switch to AI DevOps.

Attaching makes it *available*, not active. When creating a ticket, open **Select Scopes** and pick `neo4j-mcp-scope`.

### 7. Verify

> What schema do you see in neo4j?

The agent should discover and call `get_neo4j_schema` / `read-neo4j-cypher`.

![Agent calling neo4j MCP tools](images/neo4j-12-agent-calling-tools.png)

The agent can now read and write Neo4j data.

## Crusoe / Nebius (via OpenRouter)

Run the agent's model on Crusoe or Nebius GPUs. OpenRouter fronts both at one fixed endpoint; a **preset** pins each request to one provider.

### 1. OpenRouter account

1. Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
2. **Settings → Credits** — ~$10 is plenty
3. **Settings → Keys** → create one. **Copy it now** (`sk-or-v1-…`) — shown once

### 2. Create a preset per provider

**Settings → Presets → New Preset**

1. **Name** it for the pairing, e.g. `duplo-nebius-qwen`. The auto-filled **slug** is what you reference as `@preset/duplo-nebius-qwen`
2. **Add model** — e.g. `qwen3-235b-a22b-2507`
   - **Must support tool calling**, or the agent can never call a tool. Filter for it on [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models)
   - Skip `:free` variants
   - Watch for near-duplicates — plain `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507` is the Instruct one, not Thinking
3. Check **Include Provider Preferences**:
   - Type the provider name (`nebius`) and check it — this is what actually pins the request
   - **Allow fallbacks → No.** Left on, a busy provider gets silently swapped and the pin is meaningless
4. **Leave everything else blank.** Values here *override* every request — a max-tokens here becomes a hard ceiling on agent output
5. Save, and repeat for the next pairing

**Validated pairings:**

| Preset | Model | Provider | Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `duplo-nebius-qwen` | `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507` | nebius | 262144 |
| `duplo-crusoe-kimi` | `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` | crusoe | 262144 |
| — | `z-ai/glm-5.3` | crusoe | 1310720 |
| — | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | nebius | 131072 |

### 3. Point the agent at it

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api      # fixed, same for everyone
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-or-v1-...                 # your key
CLAUDE_MODEL=@preset/duplo-nebius-qwen            # or @preset/duplo-crusoe-kimi
CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=262144             # the model's real window, from the table
CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=200000            # optional; keep below the line above
```

> **⚠️ Not yet confirmed working through this repo's agent.** Leaving `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset — which the standalone Claude CLI requires for this mode — makes `build_provider_env()` fall through to the Bedrock branch, so the agent talks to Bedrock instead. Verify with step 4 before relying on it.

> **Set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` correctly.** The CLI assumes 200K for unrecognized model ids; if the real window is smaller the session hard-fails mid-run instead of compacting.

### 4. Confirm the pin

```bash
curl -s https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/messages \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer sk-or-v1-..." \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"@preset/duplo-nebius-qwen","max_tokens":50,
       "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say only OK"}]}'
```

Look for `"provider"` matching what you pinned, and `"usage": {"is_byok": false}` while on credits.

| Result | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| Wrong provider | Model string isn't `@preset/<slug>`, or fallbacks left on |
| `rate_limit_exceeded` / `upstream_provider_shared_pool` | That provider is saturated — retry, switch model, or go BYOK |

### Optional — pay Crusoe/Nebius directly (BYOK)

Same env vars; only billing changes. OpenRouter takes 5% of list price, waived above $25K/month.

1. **Settings → BYOK** — confirm Nebius and Crusoe rows exist
2. Get keys from [studio.nebius.com](https://studio.nebius.com) and [console.crusoecloud.com](https://console.crusoecloud.com) (add credits there too)
3. Add each key, mark it **Prioritized**. Check the shared-capacity-fallback setting — enabled, a failure on your key silently drops back to credits
4. Keep a small OpenRouter balance for fees
5. Re-run the step 4 curl — `usage.is_byok` should flip to `true`. Still `false` means the shared pool served it: check the key is Prioritized and the upstream account has the model

---

## Vultr

Give the agent Vultr credentials and it can manage every aspect of your Vultr account.

### 1. Get an API key

Sign up and **add a payment method** — API access stays disabled until the account is validated with a minimum charge.

1. Account name (top-right) → **Manage User**

   ![Manage User](images/vultr-01-manage-user.png)

2. Left nav → **Access → API Access**
3. If disabled, click **Enable API Access**

   ![Enable API Access](images/vultr-02-enable-api-access.png)

4. **Copy the key from the popup** — shown in full only once

### 2. Create provider + credential + scope

**Administration → Providers → IT → Other → Add** — one wizard does all three.

**Provider:**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `vultr` |
| Type | `Other` |
| Account ID | `https://api.vultr.com/v2` |
| Description | paste the curl from step 3 — **this text goes into the agent's system prompt**, and is the only way to teach it the call without a code change |

**Credential:**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `vultr` |
| Key | **`apikey`** — lowercase, type Secret, Sensitive on |
| Value | your key |


**Scope:** name it `vultr`, leave **MCP Server empty**. Save, then attach to your workspace.

### 3. Verify


Create a ticket asking the agent to list your Vultr instances and VPCs. On a new account both lists come back empty, but that still confirms authentication worked.

## Pattern for any other sponsor

Every integration above is the same four things:

1. **Provider** — `Other` type, Account ID = the API base URL
2. **Credential** — lowercase keys, Sensitive on
3. **Scope** — MCP Server set (MCP tools) or empty (plain REST)
4. **Attach to workspace**, then **enable on the ticket**

So: does the sponsor ship an MCP server? Set it on the scope. Otherwise it's a REST API.
